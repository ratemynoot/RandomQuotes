## RandomQuotes

This plugin runs on a Bukkit 1.11.2 server and allows you to populate the plugin's config.yml file with strings that will be randomly selected and broadcast into the chat window when a player with randomquotes.getquote permissions (default: everyone) types /randomquote or /rq.

## Motivation

This is a metaphorical 'cry for help'. This is my very first Java plugin and a Bukkit equivalent of 'Hello World!', while paying tribute to CK's Uncle Pete. I am using it to learn from my horrible mistakes. 

## Installation
```
Copy the jar to the 'plugins' folder for the spigot instance and (re)start the instance.
```
